This is the readme for my third assignment in Software Engineering.

This progject was created by Conor O'Kelly.

The goal of the project is to create a system software thay can generate a grid given a specific size.
This is used to represent chairs.

The software must then be able to keep track of the number and location of occupied and unoccupied chairs.

The system can change the number of occoupied chairs by adding people. removing or toggling.

The system should carry out internal testing to ensure that it is running accuratly.
